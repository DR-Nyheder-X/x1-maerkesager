# hothothot

Yet another Webpack starter

* Webpack
* Babel
* React Hot Loader
* SCSS
* Mocha (and jsdom)

Based on [react-hot-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate.git) but with added SCSS.

# dev

```
$ npm start
```

# prod

What is production?

```
$ env NODE_ENV=production npm build
```

You still have to go change the path to the js in `index.html` because I haven't decided on how I want to go about providing that file.
